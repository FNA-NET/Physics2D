# Physics2D

Physics2D is 2D physics engine for [FNA.NET](https://github.com/FNA-NET/FNA) only. It is based on the [VelcroPhysics](https://github.com/Genbox/VelcroPhysics) project, which is Farseer Physics formerly.

You can create a game, robotic simulatons or even UI feedback systems using this engine and associated tools. Everything from a simple platform game to Marsrover simulations are possible.

## Features

* Continuous collision detection (with time of impact solver)
* Contact callbacks: begin, end, pre-solve, post-solve
* Convex and concave polygons and circles.
* Multiple shapes per body
* Dynamic tree and quad tree broadphase
* Fast broadphase AABB queries and raycasts
* Collision groups and categories
* Sleep management
* Friction and restitution
* Stable stacking with a linear-time solver
* Revolute, prismatic, distance, pulley, gear, mouse joint, and other joint types
* Joint limits and joint motors
* Controllers (gravity, force generators)
* Tools to decompose concave polygons, find convex hulls and boolean operations
* Factories to simplify the creation of bodies
